Repository containing different topics and tasks for interviewing engineering candidates.

# Scope

The equipme interview is not based on trivia questions. We try to emulate real working conditions, by discussing various topics in the context of the candidate's role. 
Also, we try to discuss challenges, which an engineering team will encounter when building a complex B2B SaaS application like equipme.

- Ensure that the candidate has the necessary professional qualifications for the corresponding role
- Checking whether the candidate has the necessary prerequisites to actively improve the equipme app
- Ensure that the candidate is a professional fit for the team

## Technical milestones and goals

The candidate should discuss several questions with the team. There are no right answers (or what we think what is right), but the pros and cons should be discussed and weighed.
Also, the candidate should be able to discuss certain implementations and parts of the code which are marked in the test project.
